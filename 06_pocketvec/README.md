# 06 — PocketVec / US-align structural pocket validation

Validates predicted binding pockets across species by transferring a
reference pocket's centroid, via structural alignment, from a
crystallized species to AlphaFold models of the other species, then
comparing pocket descriptors (PocketVec) between them. Covers Objective 5
of the thesis, in two rounds.

- **`primera_seleccion/`** — Stage 1: 2 pilot OG7 groups (decanoic acid,
  arabinofuranose-P), single fixed anchor species per group.
- **`segunda_seleccion/`** — Stage 2: 3 finalist OG7 groups selected by
  pocket sequence divergence (ADP, RAP, FMN), all-against-all structural
  alignment with a dynamically chosen anchor per species.

See each subfolder's own README for its pipeline, in order, and the
manuscript sections it corresponds to.
